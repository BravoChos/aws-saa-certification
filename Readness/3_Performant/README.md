# Design Performant Architectures
1. Choose performant storage and databases
2. Apply caching to improve performance
3. Design solutions for elasticity and scalability

# Test Axioms
- Expect "Single AZ" will never be a right answer
- Using AWS managed services should always be preferred
- Fault tolerant and high availability are not the same thing
- Expect that everything will fail at some point and design accordingly
