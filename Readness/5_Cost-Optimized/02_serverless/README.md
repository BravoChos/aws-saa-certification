- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon API Gateway

# Storage: Amazon CloudFront

Use cases
- Content - Static and dynamic
- Origins -Amazon S3, EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, HTTP servers

Cost Benefits
- No cost for data transfer between S3 and CloudFront
- Can be used to reduce the compute workload for EC2 instances

# Caching with CloudFront
Considerations for estimating the cost of using Amazon CloudFront:
1. Traffic distribution
2. Requests
3. Data transfer out

Caching with CloudFront can have positive impacts on both performance and cost-optimization!
