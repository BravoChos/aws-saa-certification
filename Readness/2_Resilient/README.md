# Design Resilient Architectures
1. Choose reliable/resilient storage
2. Determine how to design decouping mechanism using AWS services
3. Determine how to design a multi-tier architecture solution using
4. Determine how to design high availability and/or fault tolerant solutions.

# Test Axioms
- Expect "Single AZ" will never be a right answer
- Using AWS managed services should always be preferred
- Fault tolerant and high availability are not the same thing
- Expect that everything will fail at some point and design accordingly
