# Key Management Service
**KMS** or AWS key management service: makes it easy to create and control encryption keys for your encrypted data and it also uses hardware security modules to secure your keys. It's integrated well with AWS services such as Amazon s3, redshift and EBS. 

Data is encrypted **at rest** (ex. data is encrypted once uploaded to S3). Encryption while in transit is handled by **SSL**

Data can be encrypted/decrypted using KMS generated keys, AWS keys or keys provided by your company.

KMS master keys are **region-specific**. KMS is offered in several regions but keys are not transferrable out of the region they were created in.

KMS will rotate keys annually and use the appropriate keys to perform cryptographic operations. Also it keeps old keys and perform operations based on the appropriate key.

When you create a volume, you have an option to encrypt the volume using keys generated by the Key Management Service.
