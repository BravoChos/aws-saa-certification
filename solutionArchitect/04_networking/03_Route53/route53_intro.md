**Section: What Is Amazon Route 53**
As with other AWS products, there are no contracts or minimum commitments for using Amazon Route 53. You pay only for the hosted zones that you configure and the number of DNS queries that Route 53 answers.

Each new Amazon Route 53 account is limited to a maximum of **50 domains**. Complete an AWS request form for a higher limit and they will respond to your request within two business days. Route 53 supports health checks over HTTPS, HTTP or TCP. 

Route 53 HTTPS health checks test **whether itâ€™s possible to connect with the endpoint over SSL** and whether the endpoint returns a valid HTTP response code. However, they do not validate the SSL certificate returned by the endpoint.
