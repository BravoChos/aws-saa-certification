**What is Amazon API Gateway**

Amazon API gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create and deploy secure application programming interfaces or api's at any scale and acts as a secure "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services. It handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls.
