# Database
The **RDS**: or Relational database service is a fully managed database service that makes it easy to launch database servers in the AWS cloud and scale them  when required. The RDS service can launch service for mySQL including variations of the mySQL database engine with MariaDB and Amazon's own enterprise version of mySQL, Amazon Aurora. Standard postgre SQL is also available and also available as Amazon's Enterprise Aurora postgre SQL. Microsoft SQL server and oracle are also available. 

**Amazon Aurora**: is a fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible, relational database engine. It combines the speed and reliablity of high-end commercial database with the simplicty and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. It delivers up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring any changes in most of your existing applictions. Aurora Cluster can grow up to 64 TB in size and replica lag -- is less than 100 miliseconds after the primary instance has written and update.

**Amazon DynamoDB**: is AWS as no SQL database as a service. It's a service service like Amazon s3 and  as such you don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure behind it. AWS takes care of everything for you and it provides high speed extremely low latency performance. 

**Amazon Redshift**: is a fast fully managed petabyte scale data warehouse that is based upon the postgre SQL database engine. 
If you're looking for a big data storage solution, redshift is perfect for this Amazon.

**ElastiCache**: is an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud it allows you to retrieve information from fast fully managed in-memory caches instead of relying for slower disk based databases. 

**The AWS Database Migration Service**: orchestrates a migration of databases over to AWS easily and securely. It can also migrate data from one database engine type to another totally different database engine type. For example you can use it to migrate from Oracle over to Amazon Aurora. 

**Amazon Neptune**: is a fast reliable fully managed graph database service. it has a purpose-built high performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and clearing the graph with millisecond latency.
