**Amazon CloudFront**: is a global content delivery network or CDN for short that securely delivers your frequently requested content to over 100 edge locations across the globe and by doing this it achieves low latency and high transfer speeds for your end-users. It also provides protection against DDoS attacks. 

**VPC** or Amazon virtual private cloud: for short lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud and you can launch AWS resources in that virtual network that you yourself define and this is your own personal private space within the AWS cloud and no one can enter it unless you allow them to enter it.

**AWS Direct Connect**: is a high speed dedicated network connection to AWS. Enterprise's can use it to establish a private connection to the AWS cloud in situations where a standard internet connection won't be adequate. 

**ELB** or AWS elastic load balancing: automatically distributes incoming traffic for your application across multiple ec2 instances and also in multiple availability zones so if one availability zone goes down. The traffic will still go to the other availability zone and your application will continue to deliver responses to requests. It also allows you to achieve high availability and fault tolerance by distributing traffic evenly amongst those instances and it can also bypass unhealthy instances.

**Amazon Route 53**: is a highly available and scalable domain name system or DNS for short and it can handle direct traffic for your domain name and direct that traffic to your back-end web server. 

**Amazon API Gateway**: is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create and deploy secure application programming interfaces or api's at any scale. It handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls.
