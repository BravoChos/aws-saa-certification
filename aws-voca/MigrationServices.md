# Migration Services
**AWS Application Discovery Service**: gathers information about an enterprise's
on-premises data centers to help plan migration over to AWS. 
Data that is collected is retained in an encrypted format in an AWS application discovery
service data store. 

**AWS Database Migration Service**: orchestrates the migration of databases over to the AWS cloud.
You can also migrate data bases with one database engine type to another totally different 
database engine type. For example you can migrate from Oracle over to AWS Aurora. 

**AWS Server Migration Service**: can automate the migration of thousands of on-premise 
workloads over to the AWS cloud. This reduces costs and minimizes our downtime for migrations

**AWS Snowball**: is a portable petabyte scale data storage device that can be used to migrate data 
from on-premise environments over to the AWS cloud. You can download your data to the 
snowball device and then send it to AWS who will then upload that to a storage service for you.
